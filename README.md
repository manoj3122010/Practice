# Practice Bioinformatics Analyses

This repository is created to serve as a comprehensive record of practice analyses utilizing a range of bioinformatics techniques. It is designed to showcase my learning process and experimentation with different methodologies, including RNA sequencing, single-cell transcriptomics, and machine learning applications in bioinformatics.

Each project within this repository reflects a hands-on approach to mastering the tools and concepts essential for modern bioinformatics research. By documenting these practice analyses, I aim to demonstrate my growing proficiency in the field and provide a resource for potential supervisors to review my work and progress.

Any queries, suggestions, or critiques will be greatly appreciated as they will help me refine my skills and approach.
